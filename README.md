# Model_NFL_Predictions

Overview
This repository contains a model to predict the outcome of NFL games week to week based on various statistical features. The model utilizes linear regression and is trained on data from prior games of the season. The key statistics considered include passing EPA, passing yards, rushing EPA, rushing yards, and receiving EPA for both offense and defense.

Data
The data directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. Ensure this data is up-to-date for accurate predictions.

Model Details
The model is implemented using scikit-learn and linear regression. The script train_model.py preprocesses the data, trains the model, and saves it for later predictions.
